Applying these principles to his lifelong interest in technology brought Andrew to DevOps (even before it was a 'thing'). He loves tackling challenges and helping large organizations improve software delivery, which is reflected in his current work on government digital service projects. </p>\n<p>Andrew earned two degrees from Florida Atlantic University with a focus on cancer therapeutic delivery systems, but found he was drawn to the tech and process-improvement aspects of anything he worked on. Now, he is happy to spend most of his day wrangling data and software — when he’s not traveling internationally or hanging out at home with his not-so-mini schnauzers.</p>\n<h3>Things Andrew has been doing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Empowering <a href=\"https://www.data.gov/\">government open data</a> with reusable processes for better security</li>\n<li>Leading large data migrations and developing software delivery pipelines for <a href=\"https://www.envestnet.com/\">financial services companies</a></li>\n<li>Bringing <a href=\"https://www.ansible.com/\">open source tools</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project\">DevOps principles</a> to heavily regulated industries</li>\n<li>Combining modern tech and automation processes to <a href=\"http://www.thetmcteam.com/\">improve telecommunications</a></li>\n<li>Promoting financial literacy through <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/DallasCashflowClub/\">community building</a> and games</li>\n<li>Exploring Costa Rica and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yMnq5shUO7Eu-MA-WG1dPoA5nRfsTSKU/view?usp=sharing\">ziplining</a> through a 'Cloud Forest' </li>\n</ul>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"path":"/team/andrew-bond","first_name":null,"name":"Andrew Bond","personal_pronouns":null,"role":"DevOps","location":"Pompano Beach, Florida","quote":null,"social":[{"name":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-a-bond/"}],"medium_posts":null,"specialties":["DevOps","Cloud Architecture","Security","World Traveler"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/civicactions.com/static/f996c509aa7eb49c49ed21be1190fa90/c0d23/andrew-bond.jpg","srcSet":"/civicactions.com/static/f996c509aa7eb49c49ed21be1190fa90/6e3cc/andrew-bond.jpg 150w,\n/civicactions.com/static/f996c509aa7eb49c49ed21be1190fa90/11c04/andrew-bond.jpg 300w,\n/civicactions.com/static/f996c509aa7eb49c49ed21be1190fa90/c0d23/andrew-bond.jpg 500w","srcWebp":"/civicactions.com/static/f996c509aa7eb49c49ed21be1190fa90/59915/andrew-bond.webp","srcSetWebp":"/civicactions.com/static/f996c509aa7eb49c49ed21be1190fa90/c83b6/andrew-bond.webp 150w,\n/civicactions.com/static/f996c509aa7eb49c49ed21be1190fa90/01af8/andrew-bond.webp 300w,\n/civicactions.com/static/f996c509aa7eb49c49ed21be1190fa90/59915/andrew-bond.webp 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
