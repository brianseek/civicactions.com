His sense of humor and thoughtful technical approach make him a natural mentor for his fellow engineers, and he runs a helpdesk to improve sandbox health, tools, and documentation for developers.</p>\n<p>Dave has a B.A. in Business and is a PHP Certified Engineer, but he also has plenty of analog hobbies. When not in front of the computer, he roasts fair trade coffee, makes yogurt, and not-so-secretly enjoys watching classic Star Trek episodes. He’s also been known to post Dr. Seuss-esque poetry to enhance conversations in Slack.</p>\n<h3>Things David has been doing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://civicactions.com/case-study/globalnet\">Helping the DSCA</a> create advanced site infrastructure</li>\n<li>Ensuring <a href=\"https://nsf.gov/\">science research</a> can be published bug-free through automated QA</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-toronto/program/david-numan/\">Presenting</a> on DevOps and automation in Toronto</li>\n<li>Leading efforts to improve development tools with <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a></li>\n<li>Supporting healthy <a href=\"https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/05-engineering/systems-sandboxes/\">sandbox setups</a> for development teams</li>\n<li>Ditching his car for a 30’ sailboat</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"path":"/team/david-numan","first_name":null,"name":"David Numan","personal_pronouns":null,"role":"DevOps","location":"Hamilton, Ontario, Canada","quote":"They call me Docker Dave.","social":[{"name":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidnuman/"},{"name":"Github","url":"https://github.com/davenuman"},{"name":"Drupal","url":"https://www.drupal.org/u/daven"},{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/dnuman"}],"medium_posts":null,"specialties":["DevOps","Team support","Automation","Docks (for boats) & Docker (for code)"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/civicactions.com/static/5725398fe312bd7dbb3f83cb5f9b4bb4/8bd16/david-numan.jpg","srcSet":"/civicactions.com/static/5725398fe312bd7dbb3f83cb5f9b4bb4/f14a1/david-numan.jpg 150w,\n/civicactions.com/static/5725398fe312bd7dbb3f83cb5f9b4bb4/8fdce/david-numan.jpg 300w,\n/civicactions.com/static/5725398fe312bd7dbb3f83cb5f9b4bb4/8bd16/david-numan.jpg 600w","srcWebp":"/civicactions.com/static/5725398fe312bd7dbb3f83cb5f9b4bb4/c9d8a/david-numan.webp","srcSetWebp":"/civicactions.com/static/5725398fe312bd7dbb3f83cb5f9b4bb4/2e1ff/david-numan.webp 150w,\n/civicactions.com/static/5725398fe312bd7dbb3f83cb5f9b4bb4/e0d50/david-numan.webp 300w,\n/civicactions.com/static/5725398fe312bd7dbb3f83cb5f9b4bb4/c9d8a/david-numan.webp 600w","sizes":"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
