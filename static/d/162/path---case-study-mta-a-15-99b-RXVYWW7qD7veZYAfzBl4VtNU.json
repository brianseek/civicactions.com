{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>Approach</h3>\n<h5>Helpful, timely info for transit riders</h5>\n<p>We helped MTA set the modern standard for using digital signage to communicate train arrival times, weather info, and service updates — making it easier for riders to plan their routes and get there on time. </p>\n<h5>Open source = cost effective</h5>\n<p>Choosing open source technology over expensive proprietary software helps the MTA lower costs and avoid vendor lock-in. Open source also offers a more flexible web-publishing approach than complex legacy solutions.</p>\n<h5>Streamlined, accessible content management</h5>\n<p>The MTA needed a single administrative site that could manage a lot of data from a variety of external feeds. We developed a Drupal 8 content model to support the MTA’s administrative dashboard so even non-technical users can make changes themselves.</p>\n<h5>Flexible solution for many devices</h5>\n<p>The MTA needed to display data reliably regardless of the device or front-end design. We created a custom decoupled (headless) Drupal theme built in React.js to adapt to different screen sizes and mobile platforms. </p>\n<h5>Connecting the Internet of Things</h5>\n<p>We built the system to connect to 3,000+ unique digital signs with AWS Internet of Things. Location-specific data for each platform is delivered instantaneously to display information that is relevant to riders. </p>\n<h5>Built-in resilience for continuous service</h5>\n<p>A few seconds can make a big difference when navigating the world’s largest subway. We made sure the system could compensate for internet lapses to keep data flowing in real time. </p>\n<h5>Making room to grow</h5>\n<p>We simplified the front-end architecture to push data from a central location to a huge number of devices. The MTA can scale the new system to accommodate signs for the entire subway system as it changes and grows. </p>\n<blockquote>\nCivicActions engineers were able to carry through complex technical requirements so that an entire city's worth of data could be captured, parsed, and displayed in a matter of a few seconds.\n<cite>Mike Madison, Senior Technical Architect, Acquia </cite>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Impact</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Subway riders have a better travel experience with up-to-date info</li>\n<li>MTA administrators easily manage data on a familiar platform</li>\n<li>Real time data helps modernize public transportation </li>\n<li>Flexible system accommodates future growth</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Explore</h3>\n<h5>Learn more about the subway</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://web.mta.info/countdwn_clocks.htm\">History and fun facts from the MTA</a></p>\n<h5>Technical deep dive</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://dev.acquia.com/blog/using-drupal-8-and-aws-iot-to-power-digital-signage-for-new-yorks-subway-system/01/10/2018/20051\">Powering Subway Signage with Drupal 8 and AWS IoT</a></p>\n<h5>In-depth perspective from our partner</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/resources/case-study/mta\">Acquia: Metropolitan Transportation Authority Case Study</a></p>\n<h5>Find out when your next train gets in</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://subwaytime.mta.info/\">MTA Subway Times</a></p>\n<figure>\n  <div> \n    <header>5.7 million</header>\n    <p>Riders using real time<br>info every day<p>\n  </div>\n  <div> \n      <header>1800</header>\n      <p>New clocks added<br>in 400 subway stations<p>\n  </div>\n</figure>","frontmatter":{"path":"/case-study/mta","title":"Connecting public transit to real time data","client_name":"New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority","partner":"","project":"MTA Digital Countdown Clocks","website":null,"background_section_title":"New system needed to support modern signage","background_section":"The MTA manages the world’s largest public transit system, helping over 11 million passengers get around New York City every day.
