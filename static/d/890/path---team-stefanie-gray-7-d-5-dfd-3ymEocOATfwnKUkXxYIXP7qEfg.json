A walking fountain of ideas with a can-do attitude, Stefanie has provided DKAN trainings from Sacramento to St. Lucia, in addition to working on QA, documentation, front-end design, and community-building.</p>\n<p>Stefanie has a B.A. and M.A. in Geography from Hunter College, and a certification in GIS (Geographic Information Systems). She first started creating maps back in elementary school, tracking hurricane patterns in her hometown — nowadays a whirlwind of travel takes her all over the map. Coffee and cats help her keep it all in balance.</p>\n<h3>Things Stefanie has been doing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping government organizations develop and maintain vast <a href=\"https://getdkan.org/about/\">open data</a> libraries</li>\n<li>Providing friendly support to the open data teams at <a href=\"https://www.healthdata.gov/\">U.S. Health and Human Services</a>, <a href=\"https://www.data.va.gov/\">U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</a>, <a href=\"https://data.ca.gov/\">State of California</a>, and <a href=\"https://data.georgia.gov/\">State of Georgia</a></li>\n<li>Empowering <a href=\"https://civicactions.com/case-study/lincs\">adult education practitioners</a> to learn and collaborate</li>\n<li>Sharing the power of open data to support <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf8-i-Hg-N0\">government transparency</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drupalasheville.com/2018/session/how-dkan-open-data-platform-empowers-scientific-community\">scientific collaboration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/dkan-blog/dkan-engineer-stefanie-gray-on-drupaleasy-podcast-its-truly-a-global-project-cce8bfbeff14\">Talking</a> about her love of SimCity 2000</li>\n<li>Trying to beat the record for riding the NYC metro as <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2012/10/23/bklyn-gal-tries-for-record-breaking-train-ride-on-nyc-subway/\">part of a campaign</a> to stop fare hikes</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"path":"/team/stefanie-gray","first_name":null,"name":"Stefanie Gray","personal_pronouns":"she/they","role":"Help Desk Support","location":"Denver, CO","quote":"Be the Leslie Knope you wish to see in the world.","social":[{"name":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefaniegray/"},{"name":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/stefaniefgray"},{"name":"Drupal","url":"https://www.drupal.org/u/stefaniegray"}],"medium_posts":null,"specialties":["GIS & Data Analysis","Customer Support","Open Data","Karaoke"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/8a9bf843b2bb4e4d0a52a876f9d472e8/8bd16/stefanie-gray.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8a9bf843b2bb4e4d0a52a876f9d472e8/f14a1/stefanie-gray.jpg 150w,\n/static/8a9bf843b2bb4e4d0a52a876f9d472e8/8fdce/stefanie-gray.jpg 300w,\n/static/8a9bf843b2bb4e4d0a52a876f9d472e8/8bd16/stefanie-gray.jpg 600w","srcWebp":"/static/8a9bf843b2bb4e4d0a52a876f9d472e8/c9d8a/stefanie-gray.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/8a9bf843b2bb4e4d0a52a876f9d472e8/2e1ff/stefanie-gray.webp 150w,\n/static/8a9bf843b2bb4e4d0a52a876f9d472e8/e0d50/stefanie-gray.webp 300w,\n/static/8a9bf843b2bb4e4d0a52a876f9d472e8/c9d8a/stefanie-gray.webp 600w","sizes":"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}}
