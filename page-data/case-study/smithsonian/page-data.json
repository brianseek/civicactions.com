By communicating regularly with stakeholders, we made sure there were no surprises, and could quickly adjust course when needed. Rapid iteration allowed us to test ideas before they were built into the final product.</p>\n<h5>Integrated tools to reach people world-wide</h5>\n<p>We worked with Smithsonian to create a social media strategy and online tools that would allow people all over the world to vote for new 3-D content and participate in discussions taking place at the museum.</p>\n<h5>Interactive features to keep things interesting</h5>\n<p>We built the site with features to keep audiences engaged beyond their museum experience. People can keep learning online through an interactive floor plan of the exhibit, 3-D viewer, and educator’s section with a forum and lesson plans.</p>\n<h5>Security for public institutions</h5>\n<p>Our careful security process and and documentation allowed Human Origins to be the first website to successfully pass The Smithsonian Institution Office of Chief Information Officer and Security Committee’s review.</p>\n<h5>Planning for future growth</h5>\n<p>By transitioning the site to the Smithsonian Institution’s in-house servers and providing support and training to staff, we ensured the Human Origins site could be easily maintained after its launch.
