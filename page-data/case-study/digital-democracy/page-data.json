We performed a technical architecture redesign which uses Drupal 8 custom entities to treat the data as if it were local.</p>\n<h5>Design with users in mind</h5>\n<p>User research helped us decide on a modern, responsive design that gives people a flawless experience on any device and can be customized for each new state.</p>\n<h5>Unlimited growth potential</h5>\n<p>We used a design evaluation process to create an expandable, dynamic solution that makes real-time data possible. The previous cumbersome data import process is eliminated, and the site can now scale to support any number of states.</p>\n<h5>DevOps for reliable updates</h5>\n<p>We put DevOps processes in place for building, testing, and releasing to make sure the platform could be updated without compromising stability. Digital Democracy development teams can focus on improving the platform rather than managing problems.</p>\n<h5>Built for sharing</h5>\n<p>We revamped Digital Democracy as a “white label solution,” available as an API to other groups and organizations looking for a similar tool to power their own advocacy efforts.</p>\n<h5>Powerful, effective search</h5>\n<p>We built a simple but powerful site-wide search feature so users can quickly find what they’re looking for. People can search for topics, speakers, committees, bills, and more — right from the home screen.</p>\n<h5>Helping people take action</h5>\n<p>Digital Democracy was built to double as an “Action Center.” Organizers can create campaigns focused on a particular bill by presenting clips of hearings, downloads, and other message-boosting content.</p>\n<blockquote>\nDigital Democracy empowers every Californian with unprecedented access to their government.

People could view records of elected officials and videos of hearings, but inconsistencies made the site difficult to navigate, especially on mobile devices. Cumbersome data processes made real-time updates impossible, and an outdated system prevented the site from scaling.","background_section_second":"Digital Democracy needed an upgrade to accommodate real-time data for three additional states. Thousands of records needed to be mapped and made searchable so people could engage accurately with their government. The site would be built as an unbranded base so other advocacy organizations could use it as a tool for their own work.","related_titles":["Sharing data to support veterans","Bringing free and open
