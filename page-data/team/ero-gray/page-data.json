Before arriving at CivicActions, he provided technology leadership for numerous nonprofits and led a tech support department at Idealist.org. He is committed to building a better world by making technology more civic-minded and human-friendly.</p>\n<p>Ero has a B.A. in Literature and Writing with a minor in Teaching from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and his undergraduate study of avant-garde poetry has helped make him expert at writing easy-to-understand technical emails.
