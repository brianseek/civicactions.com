She uses style guides, clear documentation, and user research to make sure content is approachable and helps people find what they need. Kate thrives on mission-driven work, and discovered the power of civic tech to improve lives while working at 18F. As the organization’s first content strategist, she founded the <a href=\"https://handbook.18f.gov/writing-lab/\">18F Writing Lab</a> to facilitate quality content and collaboration across departments.</p>\n<p>Kate has a B.A. in Creative Writing and German and an M.F.A. from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. When she’s not finding poetry in the mico-copy of user interfaces, she writes her own poetry and fiction and volunteers in the literary community. She enjoys cooking, hiking, and bringing the outdoors inside with her growing collection of taxidermy and bones.</p>\n<h3>Things Kate has been doing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/\">Department of Justice</a> with content strategy for large site migrations</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQVZJKR2Tk4\">Sharing</a> how organizations can set up their own collaborative writing resource centers</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/21/new-citizenship-resources/\">Creating user-friendly resources</a> about the U.S. naturalization process</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://2017.nowwhatconference.com/speakers/\">Leading a workshop</a> on agile, user-centered content</li>\n<li>Creating <a href=\"https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/03/five-questions-for-the-nasa-chief-historian/\">a speaker series</a> of influential designers </li>\n<li>Helping the National Science Foundation <a href=\"https://www.kategarklavs.com/nsf-americas-seed-fund/\">share research funding opportunities</a></li>\n<li>Publishing her “darkly funny” and “starkly poignant” <a href=\"https://bunkysbooks.com/collections/bottlecap-press/products/diffusely-yours-by-kate-garklavs\">first chapbook of poems</a></li>\n<li>Co-curating <a href=\"https://submissionpdx.org/about/\">a reading series</a> to support the Portland creative writing community</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"path":"/team/kate-garklavs-saul","first_name":null,"name":"Kate Garklavs Saul","personal_pronouns":"she/her","role":"User Experience","location":"Portland, OR","quote":"Poetry is everywhere; it just needs editing (James Tate)","social":[{"name":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-garklavs-8610a615/"},{"name":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/kategarklavs"},{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/ueberkatester"},{"name":"Website","url":"http://www.kategarklavs.com/"}],"medium_posts":null,"specialties":["Voice & Tone","User Research","Style Guides","Fiction"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/civicactions.com/static/467c37c7bb57f98f07a8d75e32b85e2b/8bd16/kate-garklavs-saul.jpg","srcSet":"/civicactions.com/static/467c37c7bb57f98f07a8d75e32b85e2b/f14a1/kate-garklavs-saul.jpg 150w,\n/civicactions.com/static/467c37c7bb57f98f07a8d75e32b85e2b/8fdce/kate-garklavs-saul.jpg 300w,\n/civicactions.com/static/467c37c7bb57f98f07a8d75e32b85e2b/8bd16/kate-garklavs-saul.jpg 600w","srcWebp":"/civicactions.com/static/467c37c7bb57f98f07a8d75e32b85e2b/c9d8a/kate-garklavs-saul.webp","srcSetWebp":"/civicactions.com/static/467c37c7bb57f98f07a8d75e32b85e2b/2e1ff/kate-garklavs-saul.webp 150w,\n/civicactions.com/static/467c37c7bb57f98f07a8d75e32b85e2b/e0d50/kate-garklavs-saul.webp 300w,\n/civicactions.com/static/467c37c7bb57f98f07a8d75e32b85e2b/c9d8a/kate-garklavs-saul.webp 600w","sizes":"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
